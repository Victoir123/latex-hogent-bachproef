  abstract     = {The segmentation of online consumers into multiple categories can contribute to a better understanding and characterization of purchasing behavior in the electronic commerce market. Online shopping databases consist of multiple kinds of data on customer purchasing activity and demographic characteristics, as well as consumption attributes such as Internet usage and satisfaction with services. Information about customers uncovered by segmentation enables company administrators to establish good customer relations and refine their marketing strategies to match customer expectations. To achieve optimal segmentation, we developed a soft clustering method that uses a latent mixed-class membership clustering approach to classify online customers based on their purchasing data across categories. A technique derived from the latent Dirichlet allocation model is used to create the customer segments. Variational approximation is leveraged to generate estimates from the segmentation in a computationally-efficient manner. The proposed soft clustering method yields more promising results than hard clustering and greater within-segment clustering quality than the finite mixture model.},

  abstract     = {Forecasts have traditionally served as the basis for planning and executing supply chain activities. Forecasts drive supply chain decisions, and they have become critically important due to increasing customer expectations, shortening lead times, and the need to manage scarce resources. Over the last ten years, advances in technology and data collection systems have resulted in the generation of huge volumes of data on a wide variety of topics and at great speed. This paper reviews the impact that this explosion of data is having on product forecasting and how it is improving it. While much of this review will focus on time series data, we will also explore how such data can be used to obtain insights into consumer behavior, and the impact of such data on organizational forecasting.},

This article introduces an integrated view of big data, traces the evolution of big data over the past 20 years, and discusses data analytics essential for processing various structured and unstructured data. This article illustrates the application of data analytics using merchant review data. The impacts of big data on key business performances are then evaluated. Finally, six technical and managerial challenges are discussed.},
